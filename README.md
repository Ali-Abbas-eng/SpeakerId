# SpeakerId
# Dynamic Speaker Identification

Kais Hasan, Ali Abbas, Santia John Jarrah





We have implemented this project using python with TensorFlow framework.

The reason behind this project is identifying the speakerâ€™s identity from the voice, this task becomes more and more difficult as speakers increase, diverse, and when the voices was obtained from non-constrained environment.

We have used features extraction methods with CNN based model and Incremental learning to solve this problem.

We participated with this project in the CAPE (Central Applied Projects Exhibition) which was organized by Tishreen University.
